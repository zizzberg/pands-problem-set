# Solution 1 
#declare int as z
#line 7 - first set of brackets declares int as an input. Second brackets declare string attached to input
#line 8 - add one to input number then times by input number and divide by 2
#line 9 - to seperate the string and variable on print command use a comma.

z = int(input("Input a number: "))
sum = (z * (z + 1)) / 2
print ("you answer is: ",sum)
